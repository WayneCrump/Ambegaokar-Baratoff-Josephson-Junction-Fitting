# Ambegaokar-Baratoff-Josephson-Junction-Fitting
A matlab program for fitting Ic data from Jospehson junctions using the AB equation for junctions and Gross equation for gap

Included is the Code for the program as well as a compiled copy that will work in the matlab runtime environment R2012a

You can important critical current data as a function of temperature in .CSV format where the first column is the temperature in Kelvin and the second column is the critical current in Amps
The fit uses the Ambegaokar-Baratoff equation [1] with the Gross gap equation [2].
There are various options when fitting. You can set the gap ratio to be a constant, you can do a two band fit where you can also set the gap ratios for the bands as equal as well as the specific heat jump ratios.
